# Summary

`logodetect` allows the detection of logos in images and videos after being trained with just one
example of a logo.  One-shot learning systems are not only great because they require little data,
but also because they practically remove the need for specialists whenever the user wants to extend
or re-purpose their functionality.
This means that the benefits are manifold: the user requires little effort to collect
and label training data, there is practically no time or economic costs for the training
procedure, and it also provides a strategic benefit for business as they become self-sufficient
for a large part of the system maintenance.
`logodetect` comes with pretrained models, data and an interface that allows users to
detect logos in images and videos with a single command. 

# Statement of need

There is plenty of literature on the use of deep-learning for detecting logos, so,
additionally to sharing pretrained algorithms with the community to get started with
one-shot logo detection and a simple interface to use such detectors, the aim of
`logodetect` is to provide a flexible architecture to facilitate the comparison of
different algorithms for one-shot object recognition. While [@NEURIPS2019_92af93f7]
published  a reference implementation with their paper, there are generally few
high-quality object recognizer architectures available to researchers.

`logodetect` works by first performing _object detection_ on input images and then running
_object recognition_ on detection results. The idea is that the user can use a generic
detector for a single class of objects (e.g. logos, traffic signs or faces) and then compare
each of its detections with the
exemplar, i.e., the sub-class that the user is trying to recognize, to determine if both
belong to the same sub-class (e.g. a concrete brand, a stop sign or the face of a loved one).

# Architecture

The inference pipeline of `logodetect` supports architectures with one or two stages.
One-stage architectures directly perform object recognition on the raw images,
and two-stage architectures first perform object detection and then object recognition
in a second stage.

To get started, we include one `Detector` based on the  Faster-RCNN architecture [@NIPS2015_14bfa6bb]
for the object-detection phase, and two `Classifier`s for the object-recognition phase. 

As a baseline for recognition, in the first `Classifier` provided by `logodetect` we embed the
provided exemplars and the detection results from the detection stage into the same latent space,
and then simply measure the Euclidean or Cosine distance between the two embeddings.
Both inputs are considered to belong to the same sub-class if their distance is below a
threshold, determined in a preliminary analysis of the training dataset. The properties
of the embedding can be modified by the user.

As a first reference against the baseline, in the second of `logodetect`'s recognizers,
we provide a modified ResNet [@deep-residual-reco] for object-recognition that directly takes
the exemplars and the detections from the first stage
and predicts if both belong to the same sub-class. Similarly to [@NEURIPS2019_92af93f7], this
network infers a distance metric after being trained with examples of different sub-classes, 
but instead of sharing the same weights and processing each input in a separate pass as
in [@Koch2015SiameseNN], it concatenates both inputs and processes them in one pass.
This concept follows more closely the architecture proposed by [@BHUNIA2019106965], where the
assumption is that the exemplars often have more high-frequency components than the detections,
and therefore the model can increase its accuracy by learning a separate set of weights for each input.
However, our proposed architecture splits the detection and classification tasks in two separate stages,
which allows the use, and comparison, of different classifiers for the second stage.

The code also provides functionality to add various transformations, so the user has the option
to augment each exemplar with different transformations if desired. The user simply adds one
or more exemplars and is good to go.
